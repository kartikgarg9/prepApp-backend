Model: gpt-4 (or gpt-3.5-turbo based on API configuration).
Usage: Helps users resolve study material queries with intelligent responses.
Example integration snippet:

const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

app.post('/api/materials/chat', async (req, res) => {
  const { query } = req.body;
  try {
    const response = await openai.createCompletion({
      model: "gpt-4",
      prompt: query,
      max_tokens: 100,
    });
    res.json({ response: response.data.choices[0].text });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send("Error with OpenAI API");
  }
});
